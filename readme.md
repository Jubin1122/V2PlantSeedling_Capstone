## CNN PLant Species Classification

Capstone Project **Machine Learnig Engineer Nanodegree**.

## How to Run?
First, you have to download the dataset from kaggle, (https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset).

The original competition link will not have the dataset in raw format, which can be found using https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data.

* If you are using google colab upload the dataset to your drive and mount it in jupyter notebook.
* In case of kaggle kernal all the required directory paths will be preloaded.
* While using personal machine, Anaconda can be used, to run jupyter notebooks
* Also, AWS sagemaker can be used for instantiating the jupyter notebook.

## Requirements

For this projects, libraries which will be used are:
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- Opencv cv2
- pandas
- numpy
- os

**command to install libraries**
`pip install package-name`

For training and deploying the model, it will be better to use GPU.
If you are using your personal computer, you might need to install `cubatoolkits` which only works for nvidia gpu processors.

I have also attached the image folder, containing all the 12 classes with 5 sample images in each of them to give an idea of the directory structure.
